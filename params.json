{"name":"FDiag","tagline":"A log-analysis toolkit to support diagnosis of failures from cluster message logs","body":"\r\n\r\nWelcome to the FDiag log-analysis project page.\r\n\r\nThe FDiag project is an international collaboration between researchers from the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Warwick, the Texas Advanced Computing Centre, and Xyratex (now Seagate Technologies). FDiag is an open-source toolkit, written in C++, that extracts message templates from syslogs, rationalized message logs, IBM BlueGene logs and Cray-XT logs, and automatically generates reports that administrators of cluster systems (both large and small) can use to infer the likely causes of system failures.\r\n\r\nThe current version of FDiag is version 3, and it can be downloaded by clicking on the download links on this page. An install script automates the installation process and dependencies, and it is provided in the package.\r\n\r\nThe following paper reports the diagnosis results from the message logs of the Lonestar supercomputer sited at the Texas Advanced Computing Centre at the University of Texas at Austin:\r\n\r\n(a) Diagnosis of failures on Lonestar,\r\n\r\nFor further information, please get in touch with the following researchers: Edward Chuah, edwardchuah@acm.org, Arshad Jhumka, H.A.Jhumka@warwick.ac.uk, James C.
